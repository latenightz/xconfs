Note: Volume controls + slstatus use Pulseaudio. I will add some configurations for Pipewire in the future.


==== CONTROLS ====

Modkey = Windows Key

volume controls:
	MOD+F11 (+)
	MOD+F10 (-)
	MOD+F9  (M)

move through the tags*
	MOD+SHIFT+X (+)
	MOD+SHIFT+Z (-)

*Loops around, meaning if you're on #1,
 you can go backwards and get to #10
