Note: due to a little glitch, /slstatus/ was labeled under my dwm update. Nothing big changed with the slstatus, just that I removed and added a few things.



Xconfs: Free to use configurations!

Modkey for dwm: WINDOWS_KEY

fun features for dwm:

Increment through tags
	Instead of using MODKEY+Tag#, you can navigate through them with:
	MODKEY+SHIFT+Z goes backwards in the tags
	MODKEY+SHIFT+X goes forwards in the tags
	Note: To prove that this is better, I added a 10th tag (which is impossible to navigate to
	without my new patch. Normally, you'd just have to click on it.)

change the volume
	MODKEY+F11 increases volume (+)
	MODKEY+F10 decreases volume (-)
	MODKEY+F9  toggles mute (0)

The bar is on the bottom, similar to Windows or MacOS (and DEs like Xfce & all that)
